                <p>DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) is a line drawing algorithm used in computer graphics to generate a line segment between two specified endpoints. It is a simple and efficient algorithm that works by using the incremental difference between the x and y coordinates of the two endpoints to plot the line.</p>
                <p>It avoids using multiple operations which have high time complexities.</p>
                <p>Due to the limited precision in the floating point representation, it produces a cumulative error.</p>

                <p>Bresenham's line drawing algorithm is a second method of generating a line that was proposed after the DDA algorithm to overcome its limitations and drawbacks. It was developed by J.E. Bresenham in 1962.</p>
                <p>It is faster than the DDA algorithm as it does not involves the use of heavy operations such as multiplication and division.</p>
                <p>It involves only integer arithmetic. Hence, it is easier to implement.</p>
